# 📚 Student Learning Styles Classification using Machine Learning

## 🎯 Project Overview
### This project applies Machine Learning techniques to classify students' learning styles (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic) based on responses to a VAK questionnaire. The aim is to develop a predictive model using the CatBoost algorithm to improve personalized learning experiences in education.
### By analyzing a dataset of 1,210 students, this study identifies patterns in learning preferences to assist educators in tailoring teaching strategies.

  Then open `Learning_Styles_classification.ipynb`.


## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature selection.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical summaries and visualizations.
3. **Model Selection**: **CatBoostClassifier** (with comparisons to Decision Tree, KNN).
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the model for best performance.
5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.

## 📌 Results

- **Baseline CatBoost Model**: **87.13% accuracy** on test data.
- **Optimized Model**: **90.10% accuracy** after tuning.
- **Comparison**:
  - **CatBoost**: Best overall performance.
  - **KNN**: Moderate accuracy but sensitive to scaling.
  - **Decision Tree**: Overfitting issues.
